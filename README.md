# Forbidden Island

You are a pilot stranded on an island and your helicopter is in pieces. To escape, you must collect all the toolkits and return to the helicopter. Careful! The island is quickly flooding.

Green = land above sea level
White = land way above sea level
Red = land below sea level but not yet flooded
Blue or Black = flooded

Use the arrow keys to move.
To restart, hit 'm' for a regular mountain layout, 'r' for random heights, and 't' for terrain. 

Use the 's' key to use your scuba gear. Only while wearing this suit can you enter the water without dying. WARNING: This will only work once and for a limited time.

Press the spacebar to pause / see these instructions (the menu) again. 

After you've collected all the pieces, return to the helicopter and escape! Best of luck
